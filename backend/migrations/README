# Alembic Migrations

This directory contains the Alembic migration scripts for the Resumator backend.

## Setting Up for Migrations

Before you can generate or apply migrations, you need to ensure your environment is set up correctly.

1.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    Make sure you have all the required dependencies installed from the `requirements.txt` file in the `backend` directory.

    ```bash
    pip install -r ../requirements.txt
    ```

    **NOTE:** The `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pydantic_settings'` error you encountered indicates that dependencies were not installed in the environment where you ran the `alembic` command.

## Generating Migrations

After making changes to the SQLAlchemy models (in `app/models/`), you can generate a new migration script:

```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Your descriptive migration message"
```

## Applying Migrations

To apply the latest migrations to your database, run:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```
