## How to Test

npm start
```

2. **Navigate to a resume and click "Customize"**

3. **Create a customization with a job description**

4. **Click the "Compare" tab to see the new layout**

5. **Test both view modes:**
   - Toggle View (default) - Switch between versions with buttons
   - Split View - See both versions side-by-side

6. **Test responsive behavior:**
   - Desktop (> 1024px): Both views work great
   - Tablet (640px - 1024px): Split view stacks, toggle view recommended
   - Mobile (< 640px): Toggle view is perfect, split view stacks vertically

## User Experience Improvements

- **640px - 1024px (Tablet):** Both views work well, split view stacks
- **> 1024px (Desktop):** Split view shows true side-by-side

## Next Steps

1. **Test the implementation** in your development environment
2. **Get user feedback** on which view mode they prefer
