  Step 1: Execute the Deployment (The Immediate Task)

  Follow the DEPLOYMENT.md guide we just finalized. The plan to use Alembic for migrations and create a secure, isolated application stack is the
  right one. This will give you a stable production environment.

  Step 2: Address the Critical Risk - Write Tests (The Highest Priority)

  Honestly, the complete lack of automated tests is the single biggest threat to the project's long-term stability. Without tests, every bug fix or
  new feature is a step into the unknown, with a high risk of breaking something else. Manual testing is not a scalable solution.

  Your immediate goal after deployment should be to establish a baseline of tests.

   * Backend (`pytest`):
       1. Start with your most critical API endpoint: user authentication. Write tests to ensure a user can register, log in, and that protected
          endpoints correctly return a 401 error without a valid token.
       2. Next, test the main CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for resumes. Can a user create a resume? Can they fetch it? Can they delete
           it?

   * Frontend (`vitest` & React Testing Library):
       1. Write a simple test for your login page. Does it render the input fields and a login button?
       2. Write a test that simulates a user logging in and being redirected to the dashboard. This will be your most valuable initial test, as it
          covers routing, authentication state, and API calls.

  You don't need 100% coverage overnight. Focus on these critical paths first. They will provide a safety net that allows you to make future changes
  with confidence.

  Step 3: Solidify Your Dependencies (Low-Hanging Fruit)

  As mentioned in the deployment guide, your dependencies are not pinned. This is a ticking time bomb. Before you build your first production image,
  please do this:

   * Backend: In your local environment, run pip freeze > backend/requirements.prod.txt. Change your backend/Dockerfile.prod to use this new file. This
      ensures the exact same library versions are used everywhere.
   * Frontend: Make sure your package-lock.json is committed to your repository.

  This is a 15-minute task that will save you from countless hours of debugging mysterious "it works on my machine" issues.

  Summary of Your Roadmap

   1. Now: Deploy using DEPLOYMENT.md.
   2. Next Week: Start writing tests. Focus on authentication and the main features. This is non-negotiable for a healthy project.
   3. Next Month: With a testing safety net in place, you can begin to confidently add new features, refactor code, and update outdated dependencies.
      Consider setting up a simple CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions to automatically run your new tests.

  Following this path will transform Resumator from a project that works into a project that is stable, maintainable, and ready for future growth.
