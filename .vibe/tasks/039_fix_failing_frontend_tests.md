## 🎯 Task Definition

### Issue Summary
**Multiple frontend tests were failing due to a combination of issues, including incorrect async handling, ambiguous element queries, and improper test cleanup.**

### Reported Symptoms
- [x] `useApplications.test.js`: 12 failed tests - **FIXED**
- [x] `ResumesPage.test.jsx`: 1 failed test - **FIXED**
- [x] `ApplicationFormPage.test.jsx`: 1 failed test - **FIXED**
- [x] `ApplicationForm.test.jsx`: 1 failed test - **FIXED**

### User Impact
- **Severity**: High
- **Affected Users**: Development team
- **Workaround Available**: No
- **Business Impact**: Lack of reliable tests slows down development and increases the risk of shipping bugs to production.

## 🔍 PHASE 1: Initial Analysis

### Root Cause Analysis

**`useApplications.test.js`**
*   **Symptom**: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'updateApplicationStatus')`
*   **Root Cause**: Tests were not correctly using `act` with `await` to handle asynchronous state updates in the hook.

**`ResumesPage.test.jsx`**
*   **Symptom**: Unused variable and potential timer leaks
*   **Root Cause**: Cleanup for fake timers was not guaranteed if test failed.

**`ApplicationFormPage.test.jsx`**
*   **Symptom**: `Found multiple elements with the text of: /Resume/i`
*   **Root Cause**: Query was matching both "Resume" and "Resume Version" fields.

**`ApplicationForm.test.jsx`**
*   **Symptom**: `Unable to find an element with the text: Company is required`
*   **Root Cause**: Test timing issue - validation messages rendered asynchronously.

## PHASE 2: Implementation

### Summary of Changes

All four failing test files have been fixed:

#### 1. `useApplications.test.js` 
**Problem**: Tests were failing due to improper async handling causing `result.current` to become null.

**Solution**:
- Changed `act(() => { promise = ... })` to `await act(async () => { promise = ... })`
- Added explicit `await act(async () => { await Promise.resolve(); })` after starting async operations
- This ensures React has time to update state before assertions are made

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/__tests__/hooks/useApplications.test.js`

#### 2. `ResumesPage.test.jsx` 
**Problem**: Unused variable and potential timer leak in fake timer test.

**Solution**:
- Removed unused `const user = userEvent.setup();` declaration
- Wrapped fake timers test in try-finally block to ensure `vi.useRealTimers()` is always called

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/__tests__/pages/Resumes/ResumesPage.test.jsx`

#### 3. `ApplicationFormPage.test.jsx` 
**Problem**: Duplicate test case and ambiguous element query finding multiple "Resume" elements.

**Solution**:
- Removed duplicate "should show validation errors for required fields" test
- Changed `getByRole('combobox', { name: /Resume/i })` to `getByLabelText(/^Resume$/i)`
- The regex `^Resume$` matches exactly "Resume" and not "Resume Version"

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/__tests__/pages/ApplicationForm/ApplicationFormPage.test.jsx`

#### 4. `ApplicationForm.test.jsx` 
**Problem**: Test couldn't find validation message "Company is required".

**Solution**:
- Changed button query from `getByText('Create Application')` to `getByRole('button', { name: /Create Application/i })`
- Wrapped first validation assertion in `waitFor()` to handle async validation properly
- The component code was correct; the issue was purely in the test timing

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/__tests__/pages/ApplicationForm/components/ApplicationForm.test.jsx`

## 📚 Key Lessons Learned

1. **Async/Await in act()**: When testing hooks that perform async operations, always use `await act(async () => {})` and ensure promises are awaited.

2. **State Update Timing**: React state updates are asynchronous. After initiating an async operation, explicitly wait for React to process state updates before making assertions.

3. **Specific Queries**: Use specific queries like `getByLabelText(/^exact$/i)` or `getByRole('button', { name: /text/i })` to avoid ambiguous element matches.

4. **Cleanup in Tests**: Always use try-finally blocks when using fake timers or other test utilities that need cleanup.

5. **waitFor for Validation**: When testing form validation, wrap assertions in `waitFor()` since validation often happens asynchronously.

## 🧪 Testing & Verification

### How to Verify the Fixes

1. **Run the complete test suite**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm test
   ```

2. **Run specific test files**:
   ```bash
   npm test useApplications.test.js
   npm test ResumesPage.test.jsx
   npm test ApplicationFormPage.test.jsx
   npm test ApplicationForm.test.jsx
   ```

3. **Check coverage**:
   ```bash
   npm test -- --coverage
   ```

4. **Monitor for flaky tests**: Run the test suite multiple times to ensure tests are stable:
   ```bash
   npm test -- --run --reporter=verbose
   ```
