# Fix XSS vulnerability in resume creation

The `POST /api/v1/resumes` endpoint is vulnerable to XSS attacks. When a resume is created with a malicious title containing a script tag, the API does not properly sanitize the input and returns the malicious script in the response. This should be fixed by properly escaping the title before it is saved to the database.
