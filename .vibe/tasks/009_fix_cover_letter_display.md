# AI Task Planning Template - Starter Framework

> **About This Template:** This is a systematic framework for planning and executing technical projects with AI assistance. Use this structure to break down complex features, improvements, or fixes into manageable, trackable tasks that AI agents can execute effectively.

---

## 1. Task Overview

### Task Title
**Title:** Fix Cover Letter Display Issue

### Goal Statement
**Goal:** The goal is to fix a bug where the cover letter content is not being displayed when a user opens the `CoverLetterEditorPage`. This is critical for allowing users to edit their cover letters.

## 2. Strategic Analysis & Solution Options

### When to use use strategic analysis
<!-- AI Agent: Use your judgment to determine when strategic analysis is needed vs direct implementation 

** CONDUCT STRATIC ANALYSIS WHEN:** 
- Multiple viable technical approaches exist
- Trade-offs between different solutions are significant
- User requirements could be met through different UX patterns
- Architectural decisions will impact furute development
- Implementation approach affects performance, security, or maintainability significantly
- Change touches multiple systems or has broad impact

** X SKOP STRATEGIC ANALYSIS WHEN:**
- Only one obvios technical solution exists
- It's a straighforward bug fix or minor enhancement
- The implementation pattern is clearly established in the codebase
- Change is small and isolated with minimal impact
- User has already specified the exact approach they want

**DEFAULT BEHAVIOR:** when in doubt, provide strategic analysis. It's better to over-communicate than to assume.

## 3. Project Analysis & Current State

### Technology & Architecture
- **Frameworks & Versions:** React 18.2.0 (with Vite), FastAPI, Python 3.9+
- **Language:** JavaScript (ES6+), Python 3.9+
- **Database & ORM:** PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy
- **UI & Styling:** Tailwind CSS, CSS Modulesv
- **Authentication:** JWT
- **Key Architectural Patterns:** Service Layer, Dependency Injection, Component-Based UI

### Current State
The cover letter editor page is not displaying the content of the cover letter, preventing users from editing it.

---
## 4. Context & Problem Definition

### Problem Statement
When a user navigates to the `CoverLetterEditorPage` for a specific cover letter, the editor appears empty. The expected behavior is that the existing content of the cover letter is loaded into the editor, allowing the user to see and modify it. This bug prevents users from editing their saved cover letters, which is a core feature of the application.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] When a user opens the `CoverLetterEditorPage`, the content of the selected cover letter is correctly displayed in the editor.
- [ ] The user can edit the content and save the changes.
- [ ] The fix does not introduce any regressions in the cover letter creation or listing functionalities.

## 5. Development Mode Context

### Development Mode Context
- **ðŸš¨ Project Stage:** Development
- **Breaking Changes:** Must be avoided
- **Data Handling:** No data migration needed
- **User Base:** All users
- **Priority:** High priority. The focus is on stability and delivering a correct fix.

---

## 6. Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- The system must fetch the cover letter content when the editor page loads.
- The fetched content must be displayed in the text editor.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** The page should load within a reasonable time.
- **Security:** API requests must be authenticated.
- **Usability:** The user should be able to seamlessly view and edit their cover letter.

### Technical Constraints
- Must use the existing `api.js` service for backend communication.
- Must follow the existing state management patterns.

---

## 7. Data & Database Changes

### Database Schema Changes
None

### Data Model Updates
None

### Data Migration Plan
None

---

## 8. API & Backend Changes

### Data Access Pattern Rules
No changes to the backend are anticipated. The issue is likely in the frontend.

### Server Actions
None

### Database Queries
None

---

## 9. Frontend Changes

### New Components
None

### Page Updates
- `frontend/src/pages/CoverLetters/CoverLetterEditorPage.jsx`: This page needs to be modified to correctly fetch and display the cover letter content.

### State Management
The state management within `CoverLetterEditorPage.jsx` will likely need to be adjusted to handle the fetched cover letter data correctly.

---

## 10. Implementation Plan

1.  **Investigate the `CoverLetterEditorPage` component:**
    *   Examine `frontend/src/pages/CoverLetters/CoverLetterEditorPage.jsx`.
    *   Trace how the `coverLetterId` is retrieved from the URL.
    *   Analyze how the cover letter data is fetched from the backend.
    *   Debug the state management related to the cover letter content.
2.  **Inspect the API call:**
    *   Check the `getCoverLetterById` function in `frontend/src/services/api.js`.
    *   Verify that the correct API endpoint is being called (`/api/v1/cover-letters/{cover_letter_id}`).
    *   Ensure the `Authorization` header is correctly sent with the request.
3.  **Backend Verification:**
    *   Examine the `get_cover_letter` endpoint in `backend/app/api/v1/cover_letters.py`.
    *   Verify the database query is correct and returns the cover letter data.
4.  **Fix the issue:**
    *   Based on the investigation, apply the necessary code changes to ensure the cover letter content is fetched and displayed correctly. This might involve fixing the data fetching logic, state management, or how the data is passed to the editor component.
5.  **Testing:**
    *   Manually test the fix by navigating to the cover letter editor page for an existing cover letter.
    *   Verify the content is displayed.
    *   Edit and save the content to ensure the update functionality works.
    *   Check for any console errors in the browser.

## 11. Task Completion Tracking

### Real-Time Progress Tracking
Progress will be tracked by commenting on the implementation plan tasks as they are completed.

---

## 12. File Structure & Organization

- **Files to modify:**
    - `frontend/src/pages/CoverLetters/CoverLetterEditorPage.jsx` (likely)
    - Possibly `frontend/src/services/api.js` or other related components.

---

## 13. AI Agent Instructions

### Implementation Workflow
- Follow the implementation plan to diagnose and fix the bug.
- Provide clear explanations of the root cause and the applied fix.
- Ensure the final code is clean, follows project conventions, and includes comments where necessary.

### Communication Preferences
- Provide updates after each major step in the implementation plan.
- If you get stuck, explain the problem and ask for guidance.

### Code Quality Standards
- Follow the existing coding style.
- Ensure there are no linting errors.

---

## 13. Second-Order Impact Analysis

### Impact Assessment
- The main risk is accidentally breaking the cover letter saving functionality. This will be mitigated by thorough testing.
- There should be no performance impact.
- This change will not affect other parts of the application.
