## üîç PHASE 1: Initial Analysis

### Step 1.1: Understand the Request
**What**: The "Additional Instructions" are not being used by the AI when generating cover letters.
**Expected**: The AI should take the "Additional Instructions" into account when generating a cover letter, in both the cover letter generation page and the new application page.
**Actual**: The "Additional Instructions" are ignored in both cases.
**Type**: Bug (Functionality)

### Step 1.2: Identify Affected Areas
**Layers Involved**:
- [x] Frontend UI Components
- [x] Frontend API Service
- [x] Backend API Endpoints
- [x] Backend Service Layer

**Primary Files**:
- `frontend/src/pages/CoverLetters/CoverLetterGeneratePage.jsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/ApplicationForm/ApplicationFormPage.jsx`
- `backend/app/api/v1/cover_letters.py`
- `backend/app/services/ai_service.py`
- `backend/app/services/cover_letter_service.py`

---

## üéØ PHASE 2: Solution Planning

### Step 2.1: Define Success Criteria
**Functional Requirements**:
- [x] The "Additional Instructions" from the cover letter generation page should be used by the AI.
- [x] The "Additional Instructions" from the new application page should be used by the AI when customizing a cover letter.

**Technical Requirements**:
- [x] The frontend should correctly pass the "Additional Instructions" to the backend.
- [x] The backend should correctly receive and use the "Additional Instructions".

### Step 2.2: Determine Solution Approach
**Chosen Approach**: Proper Fix

**Rationale**: The issue is likely a data passing problem between the frontend and backend. A proper fix will involve tracing the data flow and ensuring the "Additional Instructions" are passed correctly at each step.

### Step 2.3: Break Down into Steps
1.  **Analyze Frontend**: Investigate how the "Additional Instructions" are passed from the UI to the API service in both `CoverLetterGeneratePage.jsx` and `ApplicationFormPage.jsx`.
2.  **Analyze Backend**: Investigate how the "Additional Instructions" are received by the API in `cover_letters.py` and how they are used by the `ai_service.py` and `cover_letter_service.py`.
3.  **Implement Fix**: Correct the data passing logic in the frontend and/or backend.
4.  **Test**: Verify that the "Additional Instructions" are correctly used in both the cover letter generation page and the new application page.
