# AI Task Planning Template - Fix Cover Letter Creation

> **About This Template:** This document outlines the plan to fix a bug preventing users from creating new cover letters.

---

## 1. Task Overview

### Task Title
**Title:** Fix Cover Letter Creation Flow

### Goal Statement
**Goal:** To enable users to successfully create and save a new cover letter, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience that is consistent with the resume creation flow.

---
## 2. Strategic Analysis & Solution Options

This is a straightforward bug fix, so a deep strategic analysis is not required. The problem is a clear mismatch between the frontend's expectations and the backend's implementation.

---

## 3. Project Analysis & Current State

### Technology & Architecture
- **Frameworks & Versions:** React 18.2.0 (with Vite), FastAPI, Python 3.9+
- **Language:** JavaScript (ES6+), Python 3.9+
- **Database & ORM:** PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy
- **UI & Styling:** Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules
- **Authentication:** JWT
- **Key Architectural Patterns:** Service Layer, Dependency Injection, Component-Based UI

### Current State
Currently, users are unable to create a new cover letter. The frontend sends a request with title and content, but the backend is designed to first create an empty cover letter and then add content in a separate step. This leads to a failure in the creation process. The resume creation feature, however, works correctly by creating the record and the first version in a single API call.

## 3. Context & Problem Definition

### Problem Statement
When a user tries to create a new cover letter, the frontend sends a single request to the backend with all the necessary data (title, content, etc.). The backend's `POST /api/v1/cover-letters` endpoint, however, is only designed to create a master record for the cover letter without any content. The content is expected to be added in a subsequent call to `POST /api/v1/cover-letters/{id}/versions`. This discrepancy causes the cover letter creation to fail, providing a poor user experience.

### Success Criteria
- [x] Users can create a new cover letter from the "Create Cover Letter" button.
- [x] The new cover letter, including its content, is saved to the database in a single user action.
- [x] The backend API for cover letter creation is consistent with the resume creation API.

## 4. Development Mode Context

- **ðŸš¨ Project Stage:** Production system
- **Breaking Changes:** Must be avoided. The API change will be an enhancement, not a breaking one.
- **Data Handling:** No data migration is needed.
- **User Base:** All users are affected.
- **Priority:** High priority. This is a core feature that is currently broken.

---

## 5. Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- The `POST /api/v1/cover-letters` endpoint should be modified to accept `title` and `content`.
- When this endpoint is called, it should create a new `CoverLetter` record and a new `CoverLetterVersion` record with the provided content.
- The frontend should be reviewed to ensure it correctly calls the updated endpoint.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** The API response time should be under 500ms.
- **Security:** All backend endpoints must be protected by authentication.

---

## 6. Data & Database Changes

No database schema changes are required.

---

## 7. API & Backend Changes

### `cover_letters.py`
- The `CoverLetterCreate` schema in `app/schemas/cover_letter.py` will be updated to include a `content: str` field.
- The `create_cover_letter` function in `app/api/v1/cover_letters.py` will be updated to accept the new `content` field.
- The `CoverLetterService.create_cover_letter` method in `app/services/cover_letter_service.py` will be refactored to handle the creation of the cover letter and its initial version in a single transaction.

---

## 8. Frontend Changes

No significant frontend changes are anticipated, as it already sends the required data. However, a review of the `handleSaveCoverLetter` in `CoverLetterGeneratePage.jsx` and the manual creation flow from `CoverLetterListPage.jsx` will be conducted to ensure they align with the updated backend.

---

## 9. Implementation Plan

1.  **Backend Refactor:**
    *   Update `app/schemas/cover_letter.py` to add `content` to `CoverLetterCreate`.
    *   Update `app/services/cover_letter_service.py` to modify the `create_cover_letter` function to accept content and create a version.
    *   Update `app/api/v1/cover_letters.py` to pass the content from the request to the service.
2.  **Testing:**
    *   Add a new test case to the backend test suite to verify that creating a cover letter with content works as expected.
    *   Manually test the frontend flow to confirm the issue is resolved.

## 10. Task Completion Tracking

- [ ] Backend API refactored.
- [ ] Backend tests updated.
- [ ] Frontend manually tested.
- [ ] Task complete.

---

## 11. File Structure & Organization

**Files to be modified:**
- `backend/app/api/v1/cover_letters.py`
- `backend/app/services/cover_letter_service.py`
- `backend/app/schemas/cover_letter.py`

## 12. AI Agent Instructions

### Implementation Workflow
ðŸŽ¯ **MANDATORY PROCESS:**
1.  Implement the backend changes as described above.
2.  Ensure the changes are consistent with the existing codebase, particularly the resume creation flow.
3.  After implementation, I will manually test the changes.

### Communication Preferences
- Provide a summary of the changes after the implementation is complete.

### Code Quality Standards
- Follow PEP 8 for Python.
- Maintain consistency with the existing code style.

---

## 13. Second-Order Impact Analysis

### Impact Assessment
- The proposed changes are low-risk and isolated to the cover letter creation functionality.
- There should be no impact on other parts of the application.
- This change will improve user experience by making the cover letter creation process more intuitive and consistent with the rest of the application.
