# AI Task Planning Template - Fix Cover Letter Editor Save Button

> **About This Template:** This document outlines the plan to fix a bug that incorrectly disables the "Save" button in the cover letter editor.

---

## 1. Task Overview

### Task Title
**Title:** Fix Disabled "Save" Button in Cover Letter Editor

### Goal Statement
**Goal:** To ensure the "Save" button in the `CoverLetterEditorPage` is always enabled when there are unsaved changes, allowing users to manually save their work at any time.

---
## 2. Strategic Analysis & Solution Options

This is a straightforward bug fix, so a deep strategic analysis is not required. The problem is a clear logic issue in the frontend component.

---

## 3. Project Analysis & Current State

### Technology & Architecture
- **Frameworks & Versions:** React 18.2.0 (with Vite), FastAPI, Python 3.9+
- **Language:** JavaScript (ES6+), Python 3.9+
- **Database & ORM:** PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy
- **UI & Styling:** Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules
- **Authentication:** JWT
- **Key Architectural Patterns:** Service Layer, Dependency Injection, Component-Based UI

### Current State
In the `CoverLetterEditorPage.jsx` component, the "Save" button is disabled based on the condition `isSaving || saveStatus === 'saved'`. The `saveStatus` is managed by the `useAutosave` hook. After a save operation, `saveStatus` is set to `'saved'` and does not reset. This causes the "Save" button to remain disabled even after the saving process is complete, preventing further manual saves until another change is made to trigger the autosave hook again.

---
## 4. Context & Problem Definition

### Problem Statement
The "Save" button in the cover letter editor becomes permanently disabled after the first successful save, even when the user makes further changes to the title or content. This is because the `disabled` logic is tied to `saveStatus === 'saved'`, which is not reset after a save. This prevents users from manually saving their work, which can be frustrating and lead to a poor user experience.

### Success Criteria
- [x] The "Save" button is enabled whenever there are unsaved changes.
- [x] The "Save" button is disabled only when the application is in the process of saving (`isSaving`).
- [x] Users can manually save their cover letter multiple times.

## 5. Development Mode Context

- **ðŸš¨ Project Stage:** Production system
- **Breaking Changes:** Must be avoided.
- **Data Handling:** No data migration is needed.
- **User Base:** All users are affected.
- **Priority:** High priority. This is a core feature that is currently broken.

---

## 6. Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- The `disabled` condition for the "Save" button in `CoverLetterEditorPage.jsx` needs to be updated.
- A new state variable, `isDirty`, will be introduced to track whether there are unsaved changes.
- `isDirty` will be set to `true` when the `title` or `content` changes and they differ from the last saved state.
- `isDirty` will be set to `false` after a successful save.
- The "Save" button's `disabled` attribute will be changed to `isSaving || !isDirty`.

---

## 7. Data & Database Changes

No database schema changes are required.

---

## 8. API & Backend Changes

No backend changes are required.

---

## 9. Frontend Changes

### `CoverLetterEditorPage.jsx`
- Introduce a new state `const [isDirty, setIsDirty] = useState(false);`.
- Update the `useEffect` that tracks changes to `content` and `title` to also set `setIsDirty(true)`.
- In the `handleManualSave` and `handleAutoSave` functions, set `setIsDirty(false)` after a successful save.
- Change the "Save" button's `disabled` prop to `disabled={isSaving || !isDirty}`.

---

## 10. Implementation Plan

1.  **State Management:**
    *   Add the `isDirty` state to `CoverLetterEditorPage.jsx`.
2.  **Update Effects and Handlers:**
    *   Modify the `useEffect` hooks and save handlers to correctly manage the `isDirty` state.
3.  **Update Button:**
    *   Change the `disabled` condition of the "Save" button.
4.  **Testing:**
    *   Manually test the editor to ensure the "Save" button behaves as expected.

---

## 11. Task Completion Tracking

- [ ] `isDirty` state implemented.
- [ ] `useEffect` and save handlers updated.
- [ ] "Save" button `disabled` logic updated.
- [ ] Task complete.

## 12. File Structure & Organization

**Files to be modified:**
- `frontend/src/pages/CoverLetters/CoverLetterEditorPage.jsx`

---

## 13. AI Agent Instructions

### Implementation Workflow
ðŸŽ¯ **MANDATORY PROCESS:**
1.  Implement the frontend changes as described above.
2.  Ensure the changes are isolated to the `CoverLetterEditorPage.jsx` component.
3.  After implementation, I will manually test the changes.

### Communication Preferences
- Provide a summary of the changes after the implementation is complete.

### Code Quality Standards
- Follow the existing React/JSX coding style.

---

## 13. Second-Order Impact Analysis

### Impact Assessment
- The proposed changes are low-risk and confined to the UI logic of a single component.
- There should be no impact on other parts of the application.
- This change will significantly improve the user experience of the cover letter editor.
