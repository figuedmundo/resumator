# AI Task Planning Template - Starter Framework

> **About This Template:** This is a systematic framework for planning and executing technical projects with AI assistance. Use this structure to break down complex features, improvements, or fixes into manageable, trackable tasks that AI agents can execute effectively.

---

## 1. Task Overview

### Task Title
**Title:** Fix Cover Letter Display on Generate Page

### Goal Statement
**Goal:** The goal is to fix the issue where the list of existing cover letters is not displayed on the `CoverLetterGeneratePage`, preventing users from choosing a cover letter to use as a template.

---
## 2. Strategic Analysis & Solution Options

This is a straightforward bug fix, so no strategic analysis is needed.

---

## 3. Project Analysis & Current State

### Technology & Architecture
- **Frameworks & Versions:** React 18.2.0 (with Vite), FastAPI, Python 3.9+
- **Language:** JavaScript (ES6+), Python 3.9+
- **Database & ORM:** PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy
- **UI & Styling:** Tailwind CSS, CSS Modulesv
- **Authentication:** JWT
- **Key Architectural Patterns:** Service Layer, Dependency Injection, Component-Based UI

### Current State
The `CoverLetterGeneratePage` is not displaying the list of existing cover letters.

---

## 4. Context & Problem Definition

### Problem Statement
On the `CoverLetterGeneratePage`, there is a section that is supposed to list the user's existing cover letters, allowing them to select one as a base for generating a new one. This list is currently not appearing. This prevents users from reusing their existing work, forcing them to start from scratch each time.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] The `CoverLetterGeneratePage` correctly fetches and displays a list of the user's existing cover letters.
- [ ] The user can select a cover letter from the list.
- [ ] The fix does not introduce any new bugs or regressions.

## 5. Development Mode Context

### Development Mode Context
- **ðŸš¨ Project Stage:** Development
- **Breaking Changes:** Must be avoided
- **Data Handling:** No data migration needed
- **User Base:** All users
- **Priority:** High priority.

---

## 6. Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- The `CoverLetterGeneratePage` must fetch the list of cover letters on load.
- The fetched list must be displayed to the user.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** The page should load in a reasonable time.
- **Security:** API requests must be authenticated.

### Technical Constraints
- Must use the existing `api.js` service for backend communication.

---

## 7. Data & Database Changes

None

---

## 8. API & Backend Changes

None

---

## 9. Frontend Changes

### New Components
None

### Page Updates
- `frontend/src/pages/CoverLetters/CoverLetterGeneratePage.jsx`: This page needs to be modified to fetch and display the list of cover letters.

### State Management
- The state management within `CoverLetterGeneratePage.jsx` will likely need to be adjusted to handle the fetched list of cover letters.

## 10. Implementation Plan

1.  **Investigate `CoverLetterGeneratePage.jsx`:**
    *   Examine the code in `frontend/src/pages/CoverLetters/CoverLetterGeneratePage.jsx`.
    *   Look for the logic that is supposed to fetch the list of cover letters. This is likely a `useEffect` hook that calls a service in `api.js`.
    *   Analyze the state management for the list of cover letters.
2.  **Inspect the API Call:**
    *   Check the function in `frontend/src/services/api.js` that is responsible for fetching the list of cover letters (e.g., `getCoverLetters`).
    *   Verify that the correct API endpoint is being called (`/api/v1/cover-letters`).
3.  **Backend Verification:**
    *   Examine the `list_cover_letters` endpoint in `backend/app/api/v1/cover_letters.py` to ensure it's functioning as expected.
4.  **Fix the Issue:**
    *   Based on the investigation, apply the necessary code changes to `CoverLetterGeneratePage.jsx` to correctly fetch and display the list of cover letters. This might involve adding a `useEffect` hook if one is missing, correcting an API call, or fixing the state management.
5.  **Testing:**
    *   Manually test the fix by navigating to the `CoverLetterGeneratePage`.
    *   Verify that the list of cover letters is displayed.
    *   Check for any console errors in the browser.

## 11. Task Completion Tracking

Progress will be tracked by commenting on the implementation plan tasks as they are completed.

---

## 12. File Structure & Organization

- **Files to modify:**
    - `frontend/src/pages/CoverLetters/CoverLetterGeneratePage.jsx`

---

## 13. AI Agent Instructions

### Implementation Workflow
- Follow the implementation plan to diagnose and fix the issue.
- Provide clear explanations of the root cause and the applied fix.
- Ensure the final code is clean and follows project conventions.

### Communication Preferences
- Provide updates after each major step in the implementation plan.

### Code Quality Standards
- Follow the existing coding style.
- Ensure there are no linting errors.

---

## 13. Second-Order Impact Analysis

### Impact Assessment
- The main risk is breaking the cover letter generation functionality. This will be mitigated by thorough testing.
