- when I am in CoverLetterGeneratePage and I click on cancel, an alert show up, but alerts are old, we need a confirmation dialog instead
- when I am in CoverLetterGeneratePage and there is not cover letters , I shouldn't be able to click on Next , 
- in CoverLetterEditorPage, when in Edit the page is all the wide of the monitor, is not pleasant to the view, please follow th wide when the page is in Preview 
- when I go to  CoverLettersPage > CoverLetterEditorPage  , is not possible to save the cover letter,   I tried to add company name and position tile but I can;t, but nevertheless, right now I am creating a generic cover letter that I later I can use , or can be customized with AI, so shouldn't be mandatory to have the company or position tile attached, I think we should remove those inputs. 
- in CoverLetterEditorPage we should have a feature to save automatically, but that should be only when the cover letter is already created, if the cover letter is new, the user need to explict click on save 
- in CoverLetterEditorPage the green arrow to show the page was saved is showing up all the time, it should be displayed only when the page is saved

- in ApplicationWizard in step 2, there is a dropdown for the cover letters, when there is no cover letter in the system ,and I try to create the application, I got the below error 
API Request: POST /api/v1/applications

- ApplicationWizard - to be honest I don't know if a wizard is too much, it should be only one form, where I can select the resume and the version, I should also be able to select the cover letter and the version, or if I dont want select cover letter it should be possible as well, the wizard creates to much noise when creating an application, also when selecting the resume + version there is a checkbox to Customize  resume using AI, and when selected it show another box to give more Additional Instructions , please refactor, because now we have cover letter, the cover letter also should be able to customize using the company, job title, and job description , and also the Additional Instructions should apply to customize the resume and cover letter selected before. also noted the box of  Additional Instructions is too small, please refactor, make it visual pleasant
- Make sure that when creating the Aplication , it can be created in the database sucessfully
