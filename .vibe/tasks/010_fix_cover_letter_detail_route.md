# AI Task Planning Template - Starter Framework

> **About This Template:** This is a systematic framework for planning and executing technical projects with AI assistance. Use this structure to break down complex features, improvements, or fixes into manageable, trackable tasks that AI agents can execute effectively.

---

## 1. Task Overview

### Task Title
**Title:** Fix 404 Error for Cover Letter Detail Page

### Goal Statement
**Goal:** The goal is to fix the routing issue that is causing a "404 Page Not Found" error when a user tries to access the detail page of a cover letter (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/cover-letters/2`).

---
## 2. Strategic Analysis & Solution Options

This is a straightforward bug fix, so no strategic analysis is needed.

---

## 3. Project Analysis & Current State

### Technology & Architecture
- **Frameworks & Versions:** React 18.2.0 (with Vite), FastAPI, Python 3.9+
- **Language:** JavaScript (ES6+), Python 3.9+
- **Database & ORM:** PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy
- **UI & Styling:** Tailwind CSS, CSS Modulesv
- **Authentication:** JWT
- **Key Architectural Patterns:** Service Layer, Dependency Injection, Component-Based UI

### Current State
Currently, navigating to a cover letter's detail page results in a 404 error.

---

## 4. Context & Problem Definition

### Problem Statement
When a user navigates to a URL for a specific cover letter, they are shown a 404 error page instead of the cover letter's details. This prevents users from viewing their cover letters. The expected behavior is that the application should render a page displaying the details of the cover letter.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Navigating to `/cover-letters/{id}` (e.g., `/cover-letters/2`) successfully loads a page with the details of the corresponding cover letter.
- [ ] The fix does not negatively impact other routes in the application.

---

## 5. Development Mode Context

### Development Mode Context
- **ðŸš¨ Project Stage:** Development
- **Breaking Changes:** Must be avoided
- **Data Handling:** No data migration needed
- **User Base:** All users
- **Priority:** High priority. The focus is on stability and delivering a correct fix.

---

## 6. Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- The application must have a route defined for `/cover-letters/:id`.
- This route must render a component that displays the details of a cover letter.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** The page should load within a reasonable time.
- **Security:** API requests must be authenticated.

### Technical Constraints
- Must use the existing `react-router-dom` for routing.

## 7. Data & Database Changes

None

---

## 8. API & Backend Changes

None

---

## 9. Frontend Changes

### New Components
- `frontend/src/pages/CoverLetters/CoverLetterDetailPage.jsx` (if it doesn't exist)

### Page Updates
- `frontend/src/App.jsx`: Add or fix the route for the cover letter detail page.

### State Management
- The new `CoverLetterDetailPage` component will need to manage its own state for fetching and displaying cover letter data.

---

## 10. Implementation Plan

1.  **Investigate Frontend Routing:**
    *   Examine the main routing configuration file, which is likely `frontend/src/App.jsx`, to understand how routes are defined.
    *   Look for the route definition that should handle `/cover-letters/:id`.
    *   Check if there is a component associated with this route.
2.  **Create a Detail Page Component (if it doesn't exist):**
    *   If a component for the cover letter detail page doesn't exist, I will need to create one. A good location would be `frontend/src/pages/CoverLetters/CoverLetterDetailPage.jsx`.
    *   This component will be responsible for fetching and displaying the details of a single cover letter.
3.  **Fix the Route:**
    *   If the route exists but is pointing to the wrong component, I will correct it.
    *   If the route doesn't exist, I will add a new route to `frontend/src/App.jsx` that maps `/cover-letters/:id` to the `CoverLetterDetailPage` component.
4.  **Testing:**
    *   Manually test the fix by navigating to `/cover-letters/2`.
    *   Verify that the page loads without a 404 error and displays the correct information.

## 11. Task Completion Tracking

Progress will be tracked by commenting on the implementation plan tasks as they are completed.

---

## 12. File Structure & Organization

- **Files to modify:**
    - `frontend/src/App.jsx` (to add/fix the route)
- **Files to create (if necessary):**
    - `frontend/src/pages/CoverLetters/CoverLetterDetailPage.jsx`
    - `frontend/src/pages/CoverLetters/CoverLetterDetailPage.module.css`

---

## 13. AI Agent Instructions

### Implementation Workflow
- Follow the implementation plan to diagnose and fix the routing issue.
- If a new page component is needed, create a simple placeholder that displays the cover letter ID to confirm the routing works, then flesh out the component to display the full details.
- Ensure the final code is clean and follows project conventions.

### Communication Preferences
- Provide updates after each major step in the implementation plan.

### Code Quality Standards
- Follow the existing coding style.
- Ensure there are no linting errors.

---

## 13. Second-Order Impact Analysis

### Impact Assessment
- The main risk is introducing a routing conflict. This will be mitigated by carefully examining the existing routes.
