## üéØ Task Definition

### Issue Summary
Cover letter versioning does not follow the expected `v1` (original) and `v2` (customized) sequence, making it inconsistent with the resume versioning logic.

### Reported Symptoms
List all observable problems:
- [X] Symptom 1: Customized cover letter versions are created sequentially (e.g., v2, v3, v4...) instead of being consistently based on a "version 2" scheme for customizations.
- [X] Symptom 2: The initial version of a cover letter is not explicitly set to "v1".

### User Impact
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Affected Users**: All users creating and customizing cover letters.
- **Workaround Available**: No
- **Business Impact**: The inconsistent versioning scheme can be confusing for users and deviates from the established pattern seen in the resume feature, leading to a poor user experience.

## üîç PHASE 1: Initial Analysis

### Problem Understanding
**What**: The version number for customized cover letters increments with every new version created for a cover letter, regardless of whether it's an original or a customization.
**Expected**: The first version of a cover letter should always be `v1`. Any subsequent job-specific customization should follow a `v2 - {Company Name}` format.
**Actual**: A new cover letter gets version `v1`. The first customization gets `v2 - {Company}`. A second customization for a different company gets `v3 - {Other Company}`, instead of another `v2` variant.
**Type**: Bug (Logic Error)

### Affected Areas

**Layers Involved**:
- [ ] Frontend UI Components
- [ ] Frontend State Management
- [ ] Frontend API Service
- [X] Backend API Endpoints (Implicitly)
- [X] Backend Service Layer
- [ ] Backend Database Models
- [ ] Other: [specify]

**Primary Files**:
- `backend/app/services/cover_letter_service.py` - Contains the business logic for creating and versioning cover letters.

**Secondary Files** (May need updates):
- `backend/app/api/v1/cover_letters.py` - The API layer that calls the service. No changes are expected here, but it's part of the flow.

---

### Root Cause Analysis

**Symptom**: Customized cover letter versions are numbered sequentially (v2, v3, v4...).
**Immediate Cause**: The `customize_for_application` method in `cover_letter_service.py` calculates the new version number by counting all existing versions of the cover letter and incrementing the total.
**Root Cause**: The logic does not differentiate between the base version (`v1`) and customization versions (`v2`). It treats all versions as a single sequence, which contradicts the desired behavior where "original" is `v1` and "customized" is `v2`. A similar, though less explicit, issue exists in the `create_version` method which also relies on a simple count.

**Evidence**:
1. The `create_version` method uses `version_count = db.query(CoverLetterVersion).filter(...).count()` and `version_name = f"v{version_count + 1}"`.
2. The `customize_for_application` method uses the exact same counting logic to generate version names for customizations.
3. This contrasts with the `resume_service.py`'s `upload_resume` method, which correctly hardcodes the initial version as `"v1"`.

**Impact Chain**:
Incorrect versioning logic in service layer ‚Üí Sequential version names are generated for all new versions ‚Üí User sees confusing version numbers for customized cover letters (v3, v4...) ‚Üí Inconsistent UX compared to resume customization.

---

## üéØ PHASE 2: Solution Planning

### Success Criteria

**Functional Requirements**:
- [X] When a new cover letter is created, its initial version must be named exactly `"v1"`.
- [X] When a cover letter is customized for a company, the resulting version must be named in the format `v2 - {company}`.
- [X] If a cover letter is customized for the same company again, the existing `v2 - {company}` version should be reused/updated, not created as a new version.
- [X] If a cover letter is customized for a different company, a new version `v2 - {other_company}` should be created.

**Technical Requirements**:
- [X] All existing tests pass.
- [ ] New tests are added to verify the corrected versioning logic.
- [X] The fix is implemented in the `backend/app/services/cover_letter_service.py` file.

### Solution Approach

**Chosen Approach**: Proper Fix

**Rationale**:
- The bug stems from a clear logic error in the service layer that needs to be corrected to ensure predictable and consistent behavior.
- A proper fix aligns the cover letter functionality with the user's expectation and the pattern established in other parts of the application (resumes).

**Trade-offs**:
- **Pros**: Solves the root cause, eliminates user confusion, and improves code consistency.
- **Cons**: Requires careful modification of the service layer logic.

### Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Correct Initial Version Creation
**Priority**: Critical
**Status**: ‚úÖ Done

**Objectives**:
- [X] Modify the `create_version` method in `cover_letter_service.py`.
- [X] Ensure that when a version is created with `is_original=True`, its name is always `"v1"`.

**Changes Required**:
- `backend/app/services/cover_letter_service.py`: In `create_version`, add a condition to check the `is_original` flag. If it's true, set `version_name = "v1"`. Otherwise, use the existing counting logic for other types of versions (if any).

**Deliverables**:
- [X] Updated `create_version` method that correctly names the original version.

**Verification**:
- [X] Code change has been applied.

---

#### Step 2: Correct Customized Version Creation
**Priority**: Critical
**Status**: ‚úÖ Done

**Objectives**:
- [X] Modify the `customize_for_application` method in `cover_letter_service.py`.
- [X] Change the version naming logic to use the `v2 - {company}` format.
- [X] Ensure the check for existing customizations is precise.

**Changes Required**:
- `backend/app/services/cover_letter_service.py`: In `customize_for_application`, replace the version counting logic. The new version name should be constructed as `f"v2 - {company}"`. The query to check for an `existing_version` should be updated to look for an exact match with this new name format, rather than a broad `LIKE` query.

**Deliverables**:
- [X] Updated `customize_for_application` method with the correct versioning scheme.

**Verification**:
- [X] Code change has been applied.

## üõ†Ô∏è PHASE 3: Implementation Guidance

### File: `backend/app/services/cover_letter_service.py`

#### Change 1: `create_version` Method

**Current Code** (Relevant Section):
```python
            # Generate version number
            version_count = db.query(CoverLetterVersion).filter(
                CoverLetterVersion.cover_letter_id == cover_letter_id
            ).count()
            version_name = f"v{version_count + 1}"
```

**Required Changes**:
1. Check if `is_original` is `True`.
2. If it is, hardcode `version_name` to `"v1"`.
3. If not, retain the sequential naming for any other non-customization version creations.

**Updated Code**:
```python
            # Generate version number
            if is_original:
                version_name = "v1"
            else:
                version_count = db.query(CoverLetterVersion).filter(
                    CoverLetterVersion.cover_letter_id == cover_letter_id
                ).count()
                version_name = f"v{version_count + 1}"
```

#### Change 2: `customize_for_application` Method

**Current Code** (Relevant Section):
```python
            # Check if customized version already exists for this company
            company_suffix = f" - {company}"
            existing_version = db.query(CoverLetterVersion).filter(
                and_(
                    CoverLetterVersion.cover_letter_id == cover_letter_id,
                    CoverLetterVersion.version.like(f"%{company_suffix}")
                )
            ).first()
            
            if existing_version:
                logger.info(f"Reusing existing version for company {company}: {existing_version.version}")
                return existing_version
            
            # ...
            
            # Create customized version
            version_count = db.query(CoverLetterVersion).filter(
                CoverLetterVersion.cover_letter_id == cover_letter_id
            ).count()
            version_name = f"v{version_count + 1} - {company}"
```

**Required Changes**:
1. Define the customized version name explicitly as `v2 - {company}`.
2. Update the query for `existing_version` to use an exact match (`==`) on the new `version_name`.
3. Remove the old version counting logic.

**Updated Code**:
```python
            # Define the expected version name for the customization
            version_name = f"v2 - {company}"

            # Check if this specific customized version already exists
            existing_version = db.query(CoverLetterVersion).filter(
                and_(
                    CoverLetterVersion.cover_letter_id == cover_letter_id,
                    CoverLetterVersion.version == version_name
                )
            ).first()
            
            if existing_version:
                logger.info(f"Reusing existing version for company {company}: {existing_version.version}")
                return existing_version
            
            # ... (AI generation logic)
            
            # Create customized version
            version = CoverLetterVersion(
                cover_letter_id=cover_letter_id,
                version=version_name,
                markdown_content=customized_content,
                job_description=job_description,
                is_original=False
            )
```
