   ```
   - Check coverage percentage
   - Identify any failing tests
   - Fix if needed

2. **Run Frontend Tests**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm test -- --run --coverage
   ```
   - Check coverage percentage
   - Fix ApplicationForm test if failing
   - Verify all new tests pass

3. **Investigate ApplicationForm Test**

   - How to run tests
   - How to write tests
   - Test patterns and best practices
   - Troubleshooting guide

5. **Update README.md**
   - Add testing section
   - Add coverage badges
   - Add commands for running tests

6. **Final Validation**
   - Run full test suite 10 times (ensure no flaky tests)
   - Generate coverage reports
   - Verify CI/CD passes
   - Team walkthrough

## 📝 Notes

### Known Issues
- ApplicationForm test may be failing - needs investigation
- Some mocks may need adjustment for actual API responses
- Coverage percentages need to be verified

### Testing Patterns Used
- **AAA Pattern**: Arrange-Act-Assert in all tests
- **GIVEN-WHEN-THEN**: Clear test documentation
- **Factory Pattern**: Test data generation with factory-boy
- **Mocking**: External services (AI, file storage) are mocked
- **Fixtures**: Reusable test setup with pytest fixtures
- **React Testing Library**: User-centric testing approach

### Best Practices Followed
- ✅ Tests are independent (no shared state)
- ✅ Each test has clear purpose and documentation
- ✅ Mocks are used for external dependencies only
- ✅ Database isolation (fresh DB per test)
- ✅ Proper cleanup (resources released after tests)
- ✅ Meaningful test names (describe what is tested)
- ✅ Both success and failure paths tested
