```

### Project Standards & Guidelines

#### Coding Standards
```yaml
Frontend:
  - Component Style: Functional Components with Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, useMemo, useCallback)
  - Styling Approach: CSS Modules + TailwindCSS utility classes
  - File Naming: 
      * PascalCase for components (e.g., CoverLetterCard.jsx)
      * camelCase for utilities (e.g., apiService.js)
      * Component styles: ComponentName.module.css
  - Import Order: 
      1. React imports
      2. Third-party libraries (heroicons, clsx, axios, etc.)
      3. Local components
      4. Hooks and utilities
      5. Styles (module.css)
  - State Management: React Context API with custom hooks (useAuth)
  - Props Validation: PropTypes for all components
  - Naming Conventions:
      * Event handlers: handleEventName (e.g., handleDelete, handleSubmit)
      * Boolean props: isLoading, hasError, canEdit
      * State variables: descriptive names (e.g., coverLetters, isDeleting)
  - Code Organization:
      * One component per file
      * Extract complex logic into custom hooks
      * Keep components under 300 lines
  - Architecture & Design Patterns:
      * **Logic in Hooks**: All business logic, state management, and API calls must be encapsulated in custom hooks (e.g., `useResumes`, `useCoverLetterEditor`). Page components should be simple consumers of these hooks.
      * **Component-First Approach**: Before writing new UI, always check for a reusable component in `src/components/common/` (`PageLayout`, `BaseCard`, `Alert`, `EmptyState`, `Pagination`).
      * **Global State**: Use React Context (`src/contexts/`) for global state. The `ThemeContext` manages dark/light mode application-wide.
      * **Layouts**: All top-level page components must be wrapped in the `PageLayout` component to ensure consistent page width and padding.
  - Error Handling:
      * try-catch for async operations
      * Display user-friendly error messages
      * Log errors to console for debugging

Backend:
  - Code Style: PEP 8 compliant, formatted with Black
  - Python Version: 3.11+
  - API Pattern: RESTful with FastAPI
  - Error Handling: 
      * Custom exceptions (ValidationError, NotFoundError)
      * Proper HTTP status codes (200, 201, 204, 400, 401, 404, 422, 500)
      * Structured error responses with detail field
  - Validation: Pydantic schemas for all request/response models
  - Logging: Structured logging with structlog (INFO, WARNING, ERROR levels)
  - Documentation: 
      * Docstrings for all public methods (Google style)
      * Type hints for all function signatures
      * API endpoint descriptions in FastAPI decorators
  - Security:
      * JWT tokens with access + refresh pattern
      * Argon2/bcrypt password hashing
      * Rate limiting with Redis
      * Input validation and sanitization
      * CORS configured properly
  - Database:
      * SQLAlchemy ORM for models
      * Alembic for migrations
      * Relationship definitions with proper cascades
  - Background Tasks:
      * Celery for async operations
      * Redis as message broker
```

## üîç PHASE 1: Initial Analysis

### Step 1.1: Understand the Request
**AI Instructions**: Before touching any code, thoroughly understand what's being asked.

#### Questions to Answer:
- [ ] What is the exact problem being reported?
- [ ] What is the expected behavior?
- [ ] What is the current (incorrect) behavior?
- [ ] Are there multiple related issues, or just one?
- [ ] Is this a bug fix, refactoring, or both?

#### Output Format:
```markdown
### Problem Understanding
**What**: [Concise description of the problem]
**Expected**: [What should happen]
**Actual**: [What currently happens]
**Type**: [Bug / Performance / UX / Code Quality]
```

**Example - Good Output**:
```markdown
### Problem Understanding
**What**: CoverLetterCard delete function passes undefined ID to API
**Expected**: DELETE /api/v1/cover-letters/{id} should receive valid cover letter ID
**Actual**: DELETE /api/v1/cover-letters/undefined returns 422 error
**Type**: Bug (Data handling issue)
```

**Example - Bad Output**:
```markdown
### Problem Understanding
The delete button doesn't work properly.
```

---

### Step 1.2: Identify Affected Areas

**Secondary Files** (May need updates):
- `path/to/related1.jsx` - [Why it might be affected]
- `path/to/related2.py` - [Why it might be affected]
```

---

### Step 1.3: Gather Project Context
**AI Instructions**: Read the necessary files to understand current implementation.

#### Reading Strategy:
```
Priority 1: Files directly mentioned in the bug report
Priority 2: Main implementation files (components, services, APIs)
Priority 3: Related files (parent components, consumers)
Priority 4: Configuration and schema files
Priority 5: Tests and documentation
```

#### What to Look For:
- [ ] Current implementation approach
- [ ] Data structures and types
- [ ] Error handling patterns
- [ ] Existing tests
- [ ] TODO comments or known issues
- [ ] Design patterns in use
- [ ] Dependencies and imports

#### Tools to Use:
```bash
# Directory structure
directory_tree: Get overview of project structure

# File listing
list_directory: See what's in a specific folder

# File search
search_files: Find files by name/pattern

# Read single file
read_file: Read one file completely

# Read multiple files
read_multiple_files: Efficient batch reading (use when reading 2-10 files)
```

#### Output Format:
```markdown
### Current Implementation Analysis

**File**: `path/to/component.jsx`
**Purpose**: [What this file does]

const handleDelete = () => {
  onDelete(coverLetter.title); // BUG: Should be coverLetter.id
}
```

**Notes**:
- [Observation 1]
- [Observation 2]

---

### Step 1.4: Root Cause Analysis
**AI Instructions**: Dig deep to find the TRUE cause, not just symptoms.

#### Analysis Questions:
1. **What** is failing? (Symptom)
2. **Where** is it failing? (Location in code)
3. **Why** is it failing? (Root cause)
4. **When** does it fail? (Conditions)
5. **How** did it happen? (Origin - was it always broken or introduced recently?)

#### Root Cause Categories:
- [ ] **Data Issue**: Wrong data structure, missing fields, type mismatch
- [ ] **Logic Error**: Incorrect algorithm, wrong condition, missing validation
- [ ] **Integration Issue**: API contract mismatch, incorrect data transformation
- [ ] **Configuration Issue**: Wrong settings, missing environment variables
- [ ] **Design Flaw**: Architectural problem, wrong pattern usage
- [ ] **Dependency Issue**: Third-party library bug or incompatibility

#### Output Format:
```markdown
### Root Cause Analysis

**Symptom**: [Observable problem]
**Immediate Cause**: [Direct technical reason]
**Root Cause**: [Underlying reason]
**Why It Happened**: [How this was introduced]

**Evidence**:
1. [Finding 1 supporting the root cause]
2. [Finding 2 supporting the root cause]

**Impact Chain**:
[Root Cause] ‚Üí [Intermediate Effect] ‚Üí [Observable Symptom]

Example:
Backend schema changed to master/version pattern ‚Üí Frontend still expects flat structure ‚Üí Delete passes wrong identifier ‚Üí 422 error
```

**Example - Good Analysis**:
```markdown
### Root Cause Analysis

**Symptom**: DELETE endpoint returns 422 with undefined ID
**Immediate Cause**: onDelete callback receives undefined instead of cover letter ID
**Root Cause**: Backend changed to master/version architecture returning only metadata, but frontend component still expects old flat structure with direct content access

**Evidence**:
1. Backend returns CoverLetterResponse with only: id, user_id, title, is_default, timestamps
2. Frontend CoverLetterCard tries to access coverLetter.content which doesn't exist
3. Delete function references coverLetter.title instead of coverLetter.id

**Impact Chain**:
Backend schema migration ‚Üí API response structure changed ‚Üí Frontend data mapping broken ‚Üí Wrong parameter passed to delete function ‚Üí API validation fails with 422
```

**Example - Bad Analysis**:
```markdown
### Root Cause Analysis
The delete button is broken because the ID is undefined.
```

---

### Step 1.5: Identify Dependencies and Side Effects
**AI Instructions**: Map out what else might be affected.

#### Dependency Analysis:
- [ ] What components consume this code?
- [ ] What services does this code depend on?
- [ ] What shared utilities are involved?
- [ ] What database tables/models are affected?
- [ ] What tests cover this functionality?

#### Side Effect Analysis:
- [ ] Will fixing this break anything else?
- [ ] Are there other places with the same pattern?
- [ ] Do other features use similar data structures?
- [ ] Are there cached values that need invalidation?

#### Output Format:
```markdown
### Dependencies & Side Effects

**Upstream Dependencies** (What this code depends on):
- Backend API: `/api/v1/cover-letters` endpoint
- Data Schema: `CoverLetterResponse` model
- Auth Service: User authentication token

**Downstream Consumers** (What depends on this code):
- CoverLettersPage: Parent component managing delete flow
- CoverLetterList: List component passing data down
- Applications feature: May reference cover letters

**Potential Side Effects**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Changing data structure may affect other components
- ‚ö†Ô∏è API changes require frontend-backend coordination
- ‚úÖ Delete is isolated, low risk of side effects

**Similar Patterns in Codebase**:
- ResumeCard: Uses similar master/version pattern (reference implementation)
- ApplicationCard: May need similar updates
```

### Step 2.4: Risk Assessment
**AI Instructions**: Identify potential problems before they occur.

#### Risk Categories:
- **Technical Risks**: Breaking changes, performance issues, edge cases
- **User Impact Risks**: Downtime, data loss, UX degradation
- **Process Risks**: Testing gaps, deployment issues, communication failures

#### Risk Assessment Template:
```markdown
### Risk Assessment

#### Risk 1: [Risk Description]
**Likelihood**: [High / Medium / Low]
**Impact**: [High / Medium / Low]
**Category**: [Technical / User Impact / Process]

**Potential Consequences**:
- [What could go wrong]

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- [How to prevent or minimize]

**Contingency Plan**:
- [What to do if it happens]

---

[Repeat for each identified risk]
```

**Example - Good Risk Assessment**:
```markdown
### Risk Assessment

#### Risk 1: Breaking Changes to Other Features
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: High
**Category**: Technical

**Potential Consequences**:
- Applications feature may break if it relies on old cover letter structure
- Other components consuming cover letter data may fail

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Search codebase for all cover letter data consumers
- Test all related features after changes
- Keep backward compatibility where possible
- Add data transformation layer if needed

**Contingency Plan**:
- Have rollback procedure ready
- Deploy during low-traffic period
- Monitor error logs closely post-deployment

---

#### Risk 2: Frontend-Backend Sync Issues
**Likelihood**: Low
**Impact**: High
**Category**: Process

**Potential Consequences**:
- Frontend deployed before backend = 422 errors continue
- Backend deployed before frontend = users see wrong data structure

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Deploy backend changes first
- Verify backend works before frontend deployment
- Use feature flags if available
- Coordinate deployment timing

**Contingency Plan**:
- Quick rollback procedure documented
- On-call engineer available during deployment
```

## üõ†Ô∏è PHASE 3: Implementation Guidance

### Step 3.1: File-by-File Implementation Guide
**AI Instructions**: Provide specific guidance for each file that needs changes.

#### Template for Each File:
```markdown
### File: `path/to/file.ext`

**Current Code** (Relevant Section):
```language
[Show the current code that needs changing]
```

**Issue in This Code**:
- [Explain what's wrong]
- [Why it's wrong]

**Required Changes**:
1. [Change 1 description]
2. [Change 2 description]

**Updated Code**:
```language
[Show the corrected code]
```

**Explanation**:
- [Why this change fixes the issue]
- [How it works]
- [Any trade-offs or considerations]

**Testing This Change**:
```language
// Example test or manual verification
```
```

**Example - Good Implementation Guide**:
```markdown
### File: `frontend/src/components/CoverLetters/CoverLetterCard.jsx`

**Current Code** (Lines 15-22):
```javascript
const handleDelete = async () => {
  if (window.confirm(`Delete cover letter for ${coverLetter.title}?`)) {
    setIsDeleting(true);
    try {
      await onDelete(coverLetter.id);
    } finally {
      setIsDeleting(false);
    }
  }
};
```

**Issues in This Code**:
1. Uses `window.confirm()` instead of proper modal (inconsistent with app UX)
2. No error handling for failed delete
3. Delete confirmation moved to parent component but not removed here
4. Loading state management could be improved

**Required Changes**:
1. Remove `window.confirm()` call (parent handles confirmation)
2. Add try-catch with error handling
3. Simplify function since confirmation is external
4. Ensure loading state is set correctly

**Updated Code**:
```javascript
const handleDelete = async () => {
  setIsDeleting(true);
  try {
    await onDelete(coverLetter.id);
    // Success handled by parent component
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to delete cover letter:', error);
    // Error displayed by parent component
  } finally {
    setIsDeleting(false);
  }
};
```

**Explanation**:
- Removed `window.confirm()` because parent (CoverLettersPage) shows ConfirmDialog
- Added try-catch for proper error handling
- Loading state correctly reset in finally block
- Function now only manages its own loading state
- Parent component handles success/error messaging

**Testing This Change**:
```javascript
// Unit test
test('handleDelete calls onDelete with correct ID', async () => {
  const mockOnDelete = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue();
  const coverLetter = { id: 123, title: 'Test' };
  
  render(<CoverLetterCard coverLetter={coverLetter} onDelete={mockOnDelete} />);
  
  const deleteButton = screen.getByText('Delete');
  await userEvent.click(deleteButton);
  
  expect(mockOnDelete).toHaveBeenCalledWith(123);
});
```

### Step 3.2: Common Patterns and Best Practices
**AI Instructions**: Reference patterns used elsewhere in the project.

#### Output Format:
```markdown
### Patterns to Follow

#### Pattern 1: [Pattern Name]
**Used In**: [Where this pattern is used in the codebase]
**Purpose**: [Why this pattern is used]

**Example**:
```language
[Code example showing the pattern]
```

**When to Use**:
- [Situation 1]
- [Situation 2]

**When NOT to Use**:
- [Situation where it doesn't apply]

**Example**:

#### Patterns to Follow

##### Pattern 1: Delete Confirmation Flow
**Used In**: ResumesPage, ApplicationsPage, CoverLettersPage
**Purpose**: Consistent user experience for destructive actions

**Example** (from ResumesPage.jsx):
```javascript
// 1. State for confirmation dialog
const [deleteConfirm, setDeleteConfirm] = useState(null);

// 2. Handler to show dialog
const handleDeleteClick = (item) => {
  setDeleteConfirm(item);
};

// 3. Handler to execute delete
const handleDeleteConfirm = async () => {
  if (!deleteConfirm) return;
  try {
    await apiService.deleteItem(deleteConfirm.id);
    // Update local state
    setItems(items.filter(item => item.id !== deleteConfirm.id));
    setDeleteConfirm(null);
  } catch (err) {
    setError(err.message);
  }
};

// 4. Render dialog
<ConfirmDialog
  isOpen={!!deleteConfirm}
  onClose={() => setDeleteConfirm(null)}
  onConfirm={handleDeleteConfirm}
  title="Delete Item"
  message={`Delete ${deleteConfirm?.name}?`}
/>
```

**When to Use**:
- Any destructive action (delete, archive, reset)
- Actions that can't be easily undone
- When user data is at risk

**When NOT to Use**:
- Non-destructive actions (save, cancel, close)
- Actions with undo capability
- Low-stakes operations


---

### Step 3.3: Edge Cases to Handle
**AI Instructions**: List edge cases and how to handle them.

#### Template:

#### Edge Cases
##### Edge Case 1: [Scenario]
**Condition**: [When this happens]
**Current Behavior**: [What happens now]
**Expected Behavior**: [What should happen]
**Solution**: [How to handle it]

**Code Example**:
```language
[Code showing how to handle this edge case]
```


**Example**:

#### Edge Cases
##### Edge Case 1: Deleting Already Deleted Item
**Condition**: User clicks delete, another user deletes same item, first user confirms
**Current Behavior**: 404 error, confusing error message
**Expected Behavior**: Graceful handling with clear message
**Solution**: Check for 404 in delete handler, show appropriate message

**Code Example**:
```javascript
const handleDeleteConfirm = async () => {
  try {
    await apiService.deleteCoverLetter(deleteConfirm.id);
    setCoverLetters(prev => prev.filter(cl => cl.id !== deleteConfirm.id));
    setSuccessMessage('Cover letter deleted successfully');
  } catch (err) {
    if (err.response?.status === 404) {
      // Item already deleted
      setCoverLetters(prev => prev.filter(cl => cl.id !== deleteConfirm.id));
      setSuccessMessage('Cover letter was already deleted');
    } else {
      setError('Failed to delete cover letter. Please try again.');
    }
  } finally {
    setDeleteConfirm(null);
  }
};
```
