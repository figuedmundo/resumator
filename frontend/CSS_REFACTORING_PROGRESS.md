# Refactoring Progress: Tailwind + CSS Modules (Hybrid Approach)

You are helping me refactor a React + Tailwind project.  
Currently every component uses **CSS Modules with Tailwind `@apply`**, but this creates a lot of duplication (many components repeat the same styles).

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
- Refactor the project to **reduce duplication** while keeping the benefits of scoped styles.  
- Use a **Hybrid Approach**
