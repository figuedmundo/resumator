# Resume Customizer - Security & Performance Issues Fixed

## 🎯 Issues Resolved

### ✅ 1. Fixed 307 Temporary Redirects

**Problem**: FastAPI was redirecting requests from `/api/v1/resumes?limit=5` → `/api/v1/resumes/?limit=5` (adding trailing slash), causing unnecessary redirects and hitting rate limits faster.

**Solution**: Added `redirect_slashes=False` to FastAPI configuration in `backend/main.py`.

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/main.py`: Added `redirect_slashes=False` parameter

### ✅ 2. Relaxed Overly Aggressive Rate Limiting

**Problem**: Rate limits were too restrictive for normal app usage. Users hit limits just by navigating the app.

**Solutions**:
- Increased rate limits for better UX while maintaining security
- Implemented tiered rate limiting (read vs write operations)
- Disabled rate limiting in development mode
- Added operation-specific limits

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/app/config/settings.py`: Updated rate limiting configuration
- `backend/app/core/middleware.py`: Implemented smart tiered rate limiting

**New Rate Limits**:
- AI calls: 50/hour (was 20/hour)
- Read requests: 300/minute 
- Write requests: 60/minute
- Auth attempts: 10/hour in prod (was 5/hour)
- File uploads: 20/hour (was 10/hour)
- Development: Rate limiting disabled

### ✅ 3. Fixed Logout on Page Refresh

**Problem**: `POST /api/v1/auth/logout` was called when refreshing the page, logging users out unexpectedly.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed useAuth hook initialization to not make unnecessary API calls
- Modified logout function to optionally skip API call
- Improved session management

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/hooks/useAuth.jsx`: Fixed initialization and logout logic
- `frontend/src/services/api.js`: Simplified API service

### ✅ 4. Fixed Error Messages Auto-Disappearing

**Problem**: Error messages disappeared automatically after showing up.

**Solution**: Removed auto-clearing of error messages - now only cleared manually by user action.

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/hooks/useAuth.jsx`: Updated error handling

### ✅ 5. Added Missing Dependencies

**Problem**: `slowapi` and `bleach` were referenced in code but not in requirements.txt.

**Solution**: Added all missing dependencies with proper version constraints.

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/requirements.txt`: Added missing security packages

**Added Dependencies**:
```
slowapi>=0.1.9        # Rate limiting middleware
bleach>=6.0.0         # HTML sanitization  
cryptography>=41.0.0  # Enhanced cryptography
validators>=0.22.0    # Input validation
```

### ✅ 6. Fixed Incomplete Dockerfile.homelab

**Problem**: 
- Dockerfile.homelab was incomplete
- Incorrectly used nginx when Caddy is already configured
- Missing proper domain replacement logic

**Solution**: Created complete Dockerfile.homelab without nginx (Caddy handles static serving).

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/Dockerfile.homelab`: Complete rewrite

**Key Features**:
- Multi-stage build for minimal production image
- Domain replacement script for homelab deployment
- Proper volume mounting for Caddy integration
- Health checks and proper error handling
- No nginx (unnecessary with Caddy)

### ✅ 7. Simplified Overly Complex Security Implementation

**Problem**: `secureApi.js` had excessive client-side security that caused:
- Performance issues
- UX degradation
- False positives
- Maintenance burden

**Solution**: Created simplified `api.js` that focuses on core functionality.

**Files Created**:
- `frontend/src/services/api.js`: Simplified API service

**Removed Excessive Features**:
- ❌ Client-side input sanitization (server handles this)
- ❌ Client-side rate limiting validation
- ❌ Complex security header checking
- ❌ Redundant token validation
- ❌ Over-engineered request/response interceptors

**Kept Essential Features**:
- ✅ Token management and refresh
- ✅ Request/response interceptors for auth
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ API endpoint abstraction
- ✅ Basic retry logic

## 🚀 Performance Improvements

1. **Faster API Responses**: No more unnecessary redirects
2. **Better UX**: Users won't hit rate limits during normal usage
3. **Improved Session Management**: No unexpected logouts
4. **Simplified Frontend**: Removed performance-heavy security checks
5. **Optimized Build Process**: Streamlined Docker builds

## 🔒 Security Maintained

Despite simplifying the frontend, security is still robust:

- **Server-side**: All input validation, sanitization, rate limiting
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with refresh mechanism
- **Rate Limiting**: Smart tiered limits per operation type
- **CORS**: Proper cross-origin request handling
- **Headers**: Security headers via middleware

## 📋 Testing the Fixes

### Test Rate Limiting Fix
```bash
# Should not get 307 redirects
curl -v "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/resumes" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" 2>&1 | grep -E "(307|< HTTP)"

# Should return data without redirect
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/resumes" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### Test Dependencies
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Should install without errors
```

### Test Frontend Build
```bash
cd frontend
VITE_API_URL=https://test.example.com npm run build
# Should build successfully
```

### Test Docker Build
```bash
cd frontend
docker build -f Dockerfile.homelab -t resumator-frontend .
# Should build without errors
```

### Test Page Refresh
1. Login to the app
2. Navigate to any page
3. Refresh the page (F5)
4. Should remain logged in (no redirect to login)

## 📊 Before vs After

| Issue | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| API Redirects | 307 → 200 (2 requests) | 200 (1 request) |
| Rate Limit Hits | Frequent during normal use | Only on abuse |
| Page Refresh | Logs out user | Maintains session |
| Error Messages | Auto-disappear | User-controlled |
| Dependencies | Missing packages | All included |
| Docker Build | Failed/incomplete | Complete & working |
| Frontend Complexity | Over-engineered | Clean & maintainable |

## 🔧 Configuration Changes

### Environment Variables

The following rate limiting variables are now configurable:

```env
# Rate limiting (requests per time period)
REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE=1000      # Development default
READ_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE=300  # GET requests
WRITE_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE=60  # POST/PUT/DELETE requests
AI_CALLS_PER_HOUR=50          # AI customization calls
AUTH_ATTEMPTS_PER_HOUR=10     # Login attempts
FILE_UPLOADS_PER_HOUR=20      # File uploads
```

### Production Recommendations

For production deployment, consider:

```env
# Production settings
ENVIRONMENT=prod
DEBUG=false
REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE=60
READ_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE=100
WRITE_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE=30
AI_CALLS_PER_HOUR=25
AUTH_ATTEMPTS_PER_HOUR=5
```

## 🎉 Summary

All identified issues have been resolved with minimal breaking changes. The application should now provide a much better user experience while maintaining security standards. The codebase is more maintainable and the Docker deployment process is complete and functional.

Key improvements:
- ⚡ Faster API responses (no redirects)
- 🔄 Better session management 
- 🎯 Appropriate rate limiting
- 🛠️ Complete build process
- 🧹 Cleaner, maintainable code
- 🔒 Security maintained server-side where it belongs
